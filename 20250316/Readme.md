#### **1.1 Heterogeneous Parallel Computing**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Historical Context**: Since the dawn of computing, applications have demanded more speed and resources than available hardware could provide. Early solutions relied on improving processor speed, memory speed, and memory capacity to enhance application performance in areas like weather forecasting, engineering analyses, computer graphics, and transaction processing.
- **Shift to Parallelism**: Around 2003, the semiconductor industry faced limitations due to energy consumption and heat dissipation, halting the rapid increase in single-CPU clock frequencies. This led to the adoption of **multicore CPUs** (multiple processor cores on a single chip) and **many-thread processors** like GPUs (Graphics Processing Units).
- **Multicore vs. Many-Thread Trajectories**:
    - **Multicore CPUs**: Designed to maintain sequential program performance with multiple cores (e.g., Intel’s 24-core server processors or ARM’s 128-core processors). They prioritize low-latency execution for sequential threads.
    - **Many-Thread GPUs**: Optimized for parallel application throughput with thousands of threads (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPU). They excel in floating-point performance, offering 9.7 TFLOPS (double-precision), 156 TFLOPS (single-precision), and 312 TFLOPS (half-precision), compared to a 24-core Intel CPU’s 0.33 TFLOPS (double-precision).
- **Design Philosophies**:
    - **CPUs (Latency-Oriented)**: Use large caches, sophisticated branch prediction, and complex control logic to minimize operation latency, at the cost of chip area and power. This reduces the number of arithmetic units and memory channels.
    - **GPUs (Throughput-Oriented)**: Maximize chip area and power for arithmetic units and memory channels to handle massive parallel tasks, accepting longer individual thread latency. Small caches manage bandwidth, allowing many threads to share data efficiently.
- **Heterogeneous Computing**: Combines CPUs and GPUs, executing sequential code on CPUs and parallel, computationally intensive tasks on GPUs. NVIDIA’s **CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)**, introduced in 2007, supports this model by enabling joint CPU-GPU execution.
- **Market Impact**: GPUs’ large installed base (over 1 billion CUDA-enabled GPUs) makes them attractive for developers. Their compact form factor also enables practical applications, such as in medical imaging (e.g., MRI machines), unlike traditional large-scale parallel systems.

**Significance**:

- The performance gap between GPUs and CPUs has driven developers to offload computationally intensive tasks to GPUs, enabling new applications like deep learning.
- Heterogeneous computing leverages the strengths of both CPUs (sequential efficiency) and GPUs (parallel throughput), broadening the scope of parallel programming.

#### **1.2 Why More Speed or Parallelism?**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Application Demand**: Future applications, including molecular biology simulations, high-definition video processing, realistic gaming, and digital twins, require vast computational power to model complex, data-intensive phenomena.
- **Superapplications**: Many emerging mass-market applications were once considered supercomputing tasks. Examples include:
    - **Biology**: Molecular-level simulations enhance traditional microscopy, demanding more speed to model larger systems and longer reaction times.
    - **Media**: High-definition video and 3D visualization require parallel processing for tasks like view synthesis and real-time enhancements.
    - **Gaming**: Realistic physics simulations (e.g., dynamic car damage) replace prearranged scenes, needing significant computational throughput.
    - **Digital Twins**: Accurate modeling of physical objects for stress testing and deterioration prediction requires massive parallel computation.
- **Deep Learning**: Enabled by GPUs’ high throughput and the availability of labeled data from the internet, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing since 2012, powering self-driving cars and home assistants.
- **User Experience**: Increased speed enables better interfaces (e.g., 3D touch screens, voice/vision-based controls), enhancing usability in smartphones and other devices.
- **Parallel Potential**: These applications process large datasets, often allowing parallel computation on independent data segments, though data delivery management is critical for performance.

**Significance**:

- Parallelism is essential to meet the growing computational demands of emerging applications, ensuring continued performance improvements as hardware evolves.
- CUDA provides a practical programming model for managing parallelism and data delivery, making it accessible to a wide developer community.

#### **1.3 Speeding Up Real Applications**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Speedup Definition**: Speedup is the ratio of execution time on a slower system (e.g., single-core CPU) to a faster system (e.g., GPU). For example, 200 seconds on a CPU vs. 10 seconds on a GPU yields a 20x speedup.
- **Amdahl’s Law**: The speedup of a parallel system is limited by the sequential portion of an application:
    - If 30% of execution time is parallelizable, even a 100x speedup in that portion yields only a 1.42x overall speedup.
    - If 99% is parallelizable, a 100x speedup in that portion achieves a 50x overall speedup.
    - Achieving high speedup requires most of the application’s work to be parallelizable (often >99.9% after optimization).
- **Optimization Challenges**:
    - **Memory Bandwidth**: Many parallelized applications hit DRAM bandwidth limits, capping speedup at around 10x. Using on-chip GPU memories (e.g., caches) reduces DRAM accesses, but capacity constraints require further optimization.
    - **CPU Suitability**: Some applications run efficiently on CPUs, making GPU speedup harder. Effective heterogeneous computing assigns sequential tasks to CPUs and parallel tasks to GPUs.
- **Realistic Expectations**: Achieving >100x speedup often requires extensive algorithm tuning and optimization to maximize parallel work and minimize memory bottlenecks.
- **Application Structure** (Peach Metaphor):
    - **Pit (Sequential Code)**: Hard to parallelize, best suited for CPUs, often a small portion of execution time in superapplications.
    - **Flesh (Parallel Code)**: Easily parallelizable, ideal for GPUs. CUDA covers a broader portion of this “flesh” compared to early GPGPU methods, which were limited to graphics-specific tasks.

**Significance**:

- Understanding Amdahl’s Law and memory optimization is crucial for maximizing parallel speedup.
- Heterogeneous systems combining CPUs and GPUs enable terascale (laptops) and exascale (clusters) computing, but success depends on proper task allocation.

#### **1.4 Challenges in Parallel Programming**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Algorithm Complexity**:
    - Some parallel algorithms perform more work than sequential ones, potentially slowing down for large datasets. For example, mathematical recurrences may require redundant computation in parallel forms.
    - Techniques like **prefix sum** help convert sequential algorithms into parallel ones with equivalent complexity (covered in Chapter 11).
- **Memory Access**:
    - **Memory-Bound Applications**: Limited by latency or throughput of memory accesses rather than computation speed.
    - Optimization involves using on-chip memories to reduce DRAM access (covered in Chapters 5 and 6).
- **Input Data Sensitivity**:
    - Parallel program performance varies with input characteristics (e.g., erratic data sizes, uneven distributions), causing uneven thread workloads.
    - Techniques like data regularization and dynamic thread adjustment mitigate these issues (covered in later chapters).
- **Synchronization Overhead**:
    - **Embarrassingly Parallel Applications**: Require minimal thread collaboration, making them easier to parallelize.
    - Other applications need synchronization (e.g., barriers, atomic operations), where threads wait for others, reducing efficiency.
    - Strategies to minimize synchronization overhead are discussed throughout the book.
- **Common Patterns**: Solutions from one domain (e.g., prefix sum) can often be applied to others, making parallel programming more manageable.

**Significance**:

- These challenges highlight the need for specialized techniques to achieve high performance in parallel programming.
- The book aims to teach these techniques through practical examples and parallel patterns, making them accessible to developers.
